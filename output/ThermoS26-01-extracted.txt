Equilibrium Thermodynamics

Defn (1.1): An isolated system is a collection of matter that shares no information with the outside world.

Postulate I: There are particular states, called equilibrium states, of an isolated system that, macroscopically, are characterized by

U, the internal energy of the system, $U \geq 0$,

V, the volume of the system, $V \geq 0$,

$N_1, \cdots, N_r$, the mole numbers of the $r$ chemical components of the system, $N_i \geq 0$.

The rigid walls that isolate the system from the rest of the universe allow no change in volume, no efflux of matter, and no exchange of energy.

Defn (1.2): A composite system is the union of two isolated systems that can exchange volume, matter (chemical components) and/or energy; however, no volume, matter, or energy is exchanged with outside.

A diathermal wall in a composite system is one which separates two otherwise isolated systems and allows for the exchange of energy, but not matter or volume.

Right section labeled with "$U^\beta, V^\beta, N_1^\beta, \cdots, N_r^\beta$" and "$\beta$". Curved arrow on right side labeled "rigid walls"]

Page 3:

A diathermal piston in a composite system is one which separates two otherwise isolated systems and allows for the exchange of energy and volume but not matter.

Postulate II: There exists a function $\tilde{S}$ for an isolated system called its entropy, defined for the system at equilibrium and depending on $U, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r$, ie,

$$\tilde{S} = \tilde{S}(U, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r).$$

The entropy exists for a composite system and is the sum of the entropy functions, $\tilde{S}^\alpha$ and $\tilde{S}^\beta$, for the respective subsystems, ie,

(1.1)
$$\tilde{S} = \tilde{S}^\alpha + \tilde{S}^\beta = \tilde{S}^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, N_1^\alpha, \cdots, N_r^\alpha) + \tilde{S}^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, N_1^\beta, \cdots, N_r^\beta)$$

The entropy of an isolated system is homogeneous of degree 1, meaning

$$\tilde{S}(\lambda U, \lambda V, \lambda N_1, \cdots, \lambda N_r) = \lambda \tilde{S}(U, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r)$$

for any $\lambda > 0$.

Postulate III: The entropy of an isolated system is a concave, twice continuously differentiable, positive function over its (convex) domain

$$\Sigma_u \subseteq [[0,\infty)] = [0, \infty) \times [0, \infty) \times [0, \infty) \times \cdots \times [0, \infty)$$
$$(U) \quad (V) \quad (N_1) \quad \cdots \quad (N_r)$$

Page 4:

The entropy is a monotonically increasing function of $U$. In particular,

[notation of $\Sigma_u$]

$$\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{S}}{\partial U}\right)_{V, N_1, \cdots, N_r} > 0, \quad \forall (U, V, \vec{N}) \in \Sigma_u^o.$$

Theorem (1.3): Suppose that Postulates I-III hold for an isolated system. Then, there is a function

$$\tilde{U} = \tilde{U}(S, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r)$$

and a convex domain of definition

$$\Sigma_s \in [[0,\infty)]^{r+2} = [0, \infty) \times [0, \infty) \times [0, \infty) \times \cdots \times [0, \infty)$$
$$(S) \quad (V) \quad (N_1) \quad (N_r)$$

that satisfies

$$\tilde{U}(\tilde{S}(\omega, V, \vec{N}), V, \vec{N}) = U, \quad \forall (U, V, \vec{N}) \in \Sigma_u$$

and

$$\tilde{S}(\tilde{U}(s, V, \vec{N}), V, \vec{N}) = S, \quad \forall (s, V, \vec{N}) \in \Sigma_s$$

Moreover, $\tilde{U}$ is a twice continuously differentiable convex function with the property

$$\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{U}}{\partial S}\right)_{V, N_1, \cdots, N_r} > 0, \quad \forall (S, V, \vec{N}) \in \Sigma_s.$$

Example (1.4): Suppose that, for a unary material ($r=1$),

Page 5:

$$\tilde{S}(U, V, N) = \left(\frac{NVU R^2}{v_o \Theta}\right)^{1/3}, \quad \Sigma_u = [0, \infty)^3,$$

where $R$, $v_o$, $\Theta > 0$ are constants. Consider the function

$$\tilde{U}(s, V, N) = \frac{S^3 v_o \Theta}{NVR^2}, \quad \Sigma_s = ?$$

Then

$$\tilde{S}(\tilde{U}(s, V, N), V, N) = S, \quad \forall (s, V, N) \in \Sigma_s$$

and

$$\tilde{U}(\tilde{S}(U, V, N), V, N) = U, \quad \forall (U, V, N) \in \Sigma_u.$$

Defn (1.5): Suppose that Postulates I-III hold. Then the temperature of an equilibrium isolated system is defined as

(1.2)
$$T_u(S, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r) \equiv \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V, N_1, \cdots, N_r}.$$

Postulate IV: Equilibrium of a composite system is that state $((U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha), (U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)) \in \Sigma^{\alpha} \times \Sigma^{\beta}$ such that

$$S = S^\alpha + S^\beta$$

is at its maximum possible value.

Page 6:

Defn (1.6): The function

(1.3)
$$P_{\tilde{U}}(S, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r) := -\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{U}}{\partial V}\right)_{S, N_1, \cdots, N_r}$$

is called the pressure of a system. The function

(1.4)
$$\mu_{0,i}(S, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r) := \left(\frac{\partial \tilde{U}}{\partial N_i}\right)_{S, N, \neq N_i}$$

is called the $i^{\text{th}}$ chemical potential.

Theorem (1.7): Let $\tilde{S}$ and $\tilde{U}$ be the entropy and internal energy functions of an isolated system. Then,

$$\frac{\partial \tilde{S}}{\partial U} = \frac{1}{T_s(U, V, \vec{N})},$$

where

$$T_u(S, V, \vec{N}) = T_s(\tilde{U}(S, V, N), V, \vec{N})$$

and

$$T_s(U, V, \vec{N}) = T_u(\tilde{S}(U, V, \vec{N}), V, \vec{N}).$$

Furthermore,

$$\frac{\partial \tilde{S}}{\partial V} = \frac{P_s(U, V, \vec{N})}{T_s(U, V, \vec{N})},$$

where

$$P_{\tilde{U}}(S, V, \vec{N}) = P_s(\tilde{U}(s, V, N), V, \vec{N}),$$

and

$$P_s(U, V, \vec{N}) = P_u(\tilde{S}(U, V, \vec{N}), V, \vec{N}).$$

And, finally,

Page 7:

$$\frac{\partial \tilde{S}}{\partial N_j} = -\frac{\mu_{s,j}(U, V, \vec{N})}{T_s(U, V, \vec{N})},$$

where

$$\mu_{u,j}(S, V, \vec{N}) = \mu_{s,j,}(\tilde{U}(s, V, \vec{N}), V, \vec{N})$$

and

$$\mu_{s,j}(U, V, \vec{N}) = \mu_{u,j,}(\tilde{S}(U, V, \vec{N}), V, \vec{N}).$$

Proof Exercises. ///

Remark: We will usually abuse notation and just write

$$T_u = T_s, \quad P_{\tilde{U}} = P_s, \quad \mu_{u,j} = \mu_{s,i},$$

when the usage may inferred from the context.

Postulate V: The entropy of an isolated system is zero when the temperature is zero; that is,

$$T_s(U, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r) = 0 \implies \tilde{S}(U, V, N_1, \cdots, N_r) = 0.$$

Example (1.8): Consider a unary ($r=1$) isolated system in equilibrium with the fundamental relation

$$\tilde{S}(U, V, N) = \left(\frac{NVU R^2}{v_o \Theta}\right)^{1/3}.$$

We can set

$$\Sigma_u = [[0, \infty)]^3.$$

$\tilde{S} = 0$ for all $(U, V, N) \in \partial \Sigma_u$, where

Page 8:

$$\partial \Sigma_u = \{(U, V, N) \in \Sigma_u \mid U=0, \text{ or } V=0, \text{ or } N=0\}?$$

Recall,

$$T_s(U, V, N) = \frac{3 v_o \Theta}{NVR^2} \tilde{S}(U, V, N)$$

$$= \frac{3 v_o \Theta}{NVR} \left(\frac{NVU R^2}{v_o \Theta}\right)^{1/3}.$$

$T_s$ is not defined for all of $\Sigma_u$! It is defined for all

$$(U, V, N) \in \text{dom}(T_s) \subset \Sigma_u$$

Define

$$AZ := \{(\omega, V, N) \in \text{dom}(T_s) \mid T_s(\omega, V, N) = 0\}.$$

Then

$$AZ \subset \partial \Sigma_u. \quad (\text{Postulate } \overline{V})$$

I leave it as a homework exercise to determine $\text{dom}(T_s)$ and $AZ$.

Remark: From this point forward, we will assume that all postulates hold.

Theorem (1.9) Suppose that in a composite system $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are separated by a diathermal wall. Then, the equilibrium of the composite system may be characterized by

(1.5)
$$U^\alpha + U^\beta = U_o$$

and

(1.6)
$$T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta).$$

Page 9:

Proof: Internal energy may be exchanged between systems $\alpha$ and $\beta$ but cannot be exchanged with the outside world. Thus (1.5) must hold because of energy conservation. At equilibrium we must have

$$S(U^*) = \tilde{S}^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) + \tilde{S}^\beta(U_o - U^\alpha, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)$$

and

$$\frac{\partial S}{\partial U^\alpha} = 0.$$

Note, all other variables besides $U^\alpha$ are fixed.

$$0 = \frac{\partial S}{\partial U^\alpha} = \frac{\partial S^\alpha}{\partial U^\alpha} + \frac{\partial S^\beta}{\partial U^\beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial U^\alpha}(U_o - U^\alpha)$$

$$= [T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha)]^{-1} + [T^\beta(U_o - U^\alpha, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)]^{-1}(-1)$$

Thus,

$$T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)$$

with

$$U^\beta = U_o - U^\alpha.$$

How do we know that solutions exist and are unique?

[DIAGRAM: Plot showing two curves vs $U^\alpha$. One curve labeled "$\tilde{S}^\alpha(U^\alpha)$" is convex and increasing in $U^\alpha$. Another curve labeled "$\tilde{S}^\beta(U_o - U^\alpha)$" starts high and decreases. The curves intersect. Annotations show "$T_s^\alpha = 0$ at $U^\alpha = 0$" and "$T_s^\beta = 0$ at $U^\alpha = U_o$". The horizontal axis is labeled with "$U_o$" and "$U^\alpha$".]

Page 10:

$$\tilde{S}(U) = \tilde{S}^\alpha(U) + \tilde{S}^\beta(U_o - U)$$

[DIAGRAM: Plot of $\tilde{S}$ vs $U$ showing a concave function. The curve starts at $\tilde{S}^\beta(U_o)$ on the vertical axis, increases to a maximum, then decreases to $\tilde{S}^\alpha(U_o)$. A dashed line shows the general trend. Points marked are $U_*$ and $U_o$ on the horizontal axis.]

This proof can also be carried out by using Lagrange multipliers. Set

$$J := S^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) + S^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)$$

$$+ \lambda(U^\alpha + U^\beta - U_o)$$

Then, equilibrium is characterized by

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial U^\alpha} = [T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha)]^{-1} + \lambda,$$

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial U^\beta} = [T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)]^{-1} + \lambda,$$

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial \lambda} = U^\alpha + U^\beta - U_o,$$

which yields the same result. ///

Page 11:

The Lagrange Multiplier technique can be visualized as follows:

[DIAGRAM: Plot showing $U^\beta$ vs $U^\alpha$ coordinate system. A curve labeled "increasing $\tilde{S}$" descends from $U_o$ on the vertical axis. A horizontal line at $U_o$ is marked with "look for the max in $\tilde{S}$ along this red line". An arrow points to this as "increasing $\tilde{S}$". The axes show $U_o$ and $U^\alpha$ markings.]

Page 12:

Theorem (1.9) Suppose that in a composite system $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are separated by a diathermal piston. Then, the equilibrium of the composite system may be characterized by

(1.7)
$$U^\alpha + U^\beta = U_o,$$

(1.8)
$$V^\alpha + V^\beta = V_o,$$

and

(1.9)
$$T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta), \quad (\text{thermal equil.})$$

(1.10)
$$P^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = P^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta) \quad (\text{mechanical equil.})$$

Proof: For this let us use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Note that $\vec{N}^\alpha$ and $\vec{N}^\beta$ are fixed. Define

$$J := S^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) + S^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)$$

$$+ \lambda_u(U^\alpha + U^\beta - U^o)$$

$$+ \lambda_v(V^\alpha + V^\beta - V_o).$$

The conditions for equilibrium are

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial U^\alpha} = [T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}_1^\alpha)]^{-1} + \lambda_u,$$

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial U^\beta} = [T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, N^\beta)]^{-1} + \lambda_u,$$

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial V^\alpha} = \frac{-P^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha)}{T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, N^\alpha)} + \lambda_v,$$

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial V^\beta} = \frac{-P^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)}{T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, N^\beta)} + \lambda_v.$$

Page 13:

and

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial \lambda_u} = U^\alpha + U^\beta - U_o,$$

$$0 = \frac{\partial J}{\partial \lambda_v} = V^\alpha + V^\beta - V_o.$$

The result is clear. ///

Here, we have used the fact that

$$\frac{\partial \tilde{S}^\alpha}{\partial U^\alpha} = \frac{1}{T^\alpha}$$

$$\frac{\partial S^\alpha}{\partial V^\alpha} = \frac{P^\alpha}{T^\alpha}$$

and

$$\frac{\partial S^\alpha}{\partial N_i^\alpha} = -\frac{\mu_i^\alpha}{T^\alpha}$$

As a short hand, we will write

$$d\tilde{U}^\alpha = T_u^\alpha dS^\alpha - P_o^\alpha dN^\alpha + \sum_{i=1}^r \mu_{i,}^\alpha dN_i^\alpha$$

and

$$d\tilde{S}^\alpha = \frac{1}{T_s^\alpha}dU^\alpha + \frac{P_s^\alpha}{T_s^\alpha} dV^\alpha - \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{\mu_{s,i}^\alpha}{T_s^\alpha} dN_i^\alpha.$$

Using our abusive notations, we have

$$d\tilde{S}^\alpha = \frac{1}{T^\alpha}dU^\alpha + \frac{P^\alpha}{T^\alpha} dV^\alpha - \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{\tilde{\mu}_i}{T_i} dN_i^\alpha,$$

for example.

Page 14:

Theorem (1.10): Suppose that a composite system is comprised of two otherwise isolated systems with no barrier between the systems. Suppose that

$$S^\alpha = S^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha)$$

and

$$S^\beta = S^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta)$$

are the fundamental entropy relations for the two systems. Then the equilibrium state is defined by the relations

(1.11)
$$U^\alpha + U^\beta = U_o$$

(1.12)
$$V^\alpha + V^\beta = V_o$$

and

(1.13)
$$N_i^\alpha + N_i^\beta = N_{o,i}$$

where $U_o, V_o, N_{o,i} > 0$, and

(1.14)
$$T^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = T^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta) \quad (\text{thermal equil.})$$

(1.15)
$$P^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = P^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta) \quad (\text{mech. equil.})$$

(1.16)
$$\mu_i^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) = \mu_i^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta) \quad (\text{chem. equil.})$$

Proof: The procedure is the same. One can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to do the calculation. In particular, define

$$J := S^\alpha(U^\alpha, V^\alpha, \vec{N}^\alpha) + S^\beta(U^\beta, V^\beta, \vec{N}^\beta) + \lambda_u(U^\alpha + U^\beta - U^o)$$

$$+ \lambda_v(V^\alpha + V^\beta - V_o) + \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i(N_i^\alpha + N_i^\beta - N_{o,i}). \quad ///$$
