Equilibrium Thermodynamics

Def. (1.1): An isolated system is a collection of matter that shares no information with the outside world.

Postulate I: There are particular states, called equilibrium states of an isolated system that, microscopically, are characterized by:
- U, the internal energy of the system, U > 0,
- V, the volume of the system, V ≫ 0,
- N1, ..., Nr, the mole number of the r chemical components of the system, Ni > 0.

[FIGURE: Isolated system with rigid walls]

The rigid walls that isolate the system from the rest of the universe allow no change in volume nor exchange of matter, and no exchange of energy.

Def. (1.2): A composite system is the union of two isolated systems (chemical components) that can exchange volume, matter (chemical components) and/or energy, however no volume, matter, or energy is exchanged with outside.

[FIGURE: Composite system with diathermal wall]

A diathermal wall in a composite system is one which separates two otherwise isolated systems and allows for the exchange of energy, but not matter or volume.

Postulate II: There exists a function S for an isolated system called its entropy, defined for the system at equilibrium and depending on (U, V, N1, ..., Nr), ie.,

S̃ = S̃(U, V, N1, ..., Nr)

The entropy shifts for a composite system and the sum of the entropy functions, S̃α and S̃β, for the respective subsystems, ie.,

S̃ = S̃α + S̃β = S̃α(U^α, V^α, Ñ^α) + S̃β(U^β, V^β, Ñ^β)

The entropy of an isolated system is homogeneous of degree 1, meaning:

S̃(λU, λV, λN1, ... λNr) = λ S̃(U, V, N1, ... Nr)

for any λ > 0.

Postulate III: The entropy of an isolated system is a concave, twice continuously differentiable, positive function over its (convex) domain:

∑_U ⊆ [0, ∞)^r = [0, ∞) × [0, ∞) × [0, ∞) × ... × [0, ∞)
   (U)   (V)   (N1)    (Nr)

The entropy is a monotonically increasing function of U. In particular:

(∂S̃/∂U)_{V,N1,...,Nr} > 0, ∀(U,V,N) ∈ ∑_U.

Theorem (1.3): Suppose that Postulates I-III hold for an isolated system. Then, there is a function:

Û = Û(S, V, N1, ..., Nr)

and a convex domain of definition:

∑_S ⊆ [0, ∞) = [0, ∞) × [0, ∞) × [0, ∞) × ... × [0, ∞)
   (S)   (V)   (N1)    (Nr)

that satisfies:
- Û(S̃(U,V,N), V, N) = U, ∀(U,V,N) ∈ ∑_U
- S̃(Û(S,V,N), V, N) = S, ∀(S,V,N) ∈ ∑_S

Moreover, Û is a twice continuously differentiable convex function with the property:

(∂Û/∂S)_{V,N1,...,Nr} > 0, ∀(S,V,N) ∈ ∑_S.

Example (1.4): For a unary material (r=1), consider the function:

S̃(U,V,N) = (NVU R^2 / v_0 θ)^(1/3), ∑_V = [0, ∞]^3

With specific formulations for Û and constants:
- R, v_0, θ > 0 are constants
- Û(S,V,N) = (S^3 v_0 θ) / (NVR^2)
- Specific details about ∑_S to be determined

Def. (1.5): Temperature of an equilibrium isolated system is defined as:

T_0(S,V,N1, ..., Nr) ≡ (∂S/∂U)_{V,N1,...,Nr}^{-1}

Postulate IV: Equilibrium of a composite system is a state where subsystems are in equilibrium such that:

S = S^α + S^β
is at its maximum possible value.
