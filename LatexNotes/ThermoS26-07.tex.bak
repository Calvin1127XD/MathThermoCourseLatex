\section{Equilibrium with a heat Bath}

Consider two isolated systems that are
initially isolated from each other.
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/ThermoS26-05-fig-3.pdf}
\caption{Two isolated systems initially separated by insulating walls.}
\label{fig:thermos26-05-isolated-systems}
\end{figure}

Now, let us remove the isolating walls so
that energy, volume, and mass may be
exchanged.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/ThermoS26-05-fig-4.pdf}
\caption{Isolating wall removed so energy, volume, and mass can be exchanged.}
\label{fig:thermos26-05-wall-removed}
\end{figure}

The entropy will attain its maximum at equilibrium and
\[
T^\alpha=T^\beta
\]
\[
P^\alpha=P^\beta
\]
\[
\mu_i^\alpha=\mu_i^\beta,\qquad i=1,\ldots,r.
\]

How can we characterize equilibrium?

Now, suppose that instead of isolating from
the universe, our composite system is put
into contact with a heat bath.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:heat-bath}
\textup{(5.9)} A heat bath is an otherwise-
isolated thermodynamic system that is so large
that, when it exchanges a finite amount of
energy with an otherwise-isolated,
composite system, its temperature, pressure, and
chemical potential changes are so small as to be
negligible.
\end{definition}

Similarly, we have

heat-pressure bath: finite exchanges of energy and volume
lead to negligible changes in $T$, $P$, and $\mu$ in baths.

A heat-pressure-chemical bath is defined analogously.

Let us consider a picture for the case of the
heat bath.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figures/ThermoS26-05-fig-5.pdf}
\caption{Composite system in contact with a heat bath.}
\label{fig:thermos26-05-heat-bath}
\end{figure}

Let us recall the "integrated form" of the
entropy function.
\[
\tilde{S}^B=\tilde{S}^B(U^B,V^B,N^B)
=\frac{1}{T^0}U^B+\frac{P^0}{T^0}V^B-\frac{\mu^0}{T^0}\cdot N^B
\]

where
\[
T^0=T^0(U^0,V^0,N^0)
\]

et cetera. We will write
\[
S^{tot}=\tilde{S}^B+\tilde{S}^\alpha+\tilde{S}^\beta
\]
\[
=\tilde{S}^B+\tilde{S}^{\alpha+\beta}
\]

Now, our system will not exchange volume or
mass with the bath, only energy, because
we will replace the horizontal isolations
wall with a diathermal wall.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figures/ThermoS26-05-fig-6.pdf}
\caption{Diathermal wall configuration: only energy exchange with the bath.}
\label{fig:thermos26-05-diathermal-wall}
\end{figure}

We know that, at equilibrium
\[
T^\alpha=T^\beta=T^B=T_0.
\]

Recall the deviations of $T^B$ from $T_0$ at equilibrium
is assumed negligible.

System $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can exchange energy.
System $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can exchange volume and mass
with each other but not with the bath.

Thus,
\[
S^{tot,eq}=\max_{C}\{\tilde{S}^B+\tilde{S}^{\alpha+\beta}\}
\]

Now
\[
\tilde{S}^B=\frac{1}{T_0}U^B+\frac{P_0}{T_0}V^B-\frac{\mu_0}{T_0}\cdot N^B
\]

The changes in $T^B$, $P^B$, $\mu^B$ from $T_0$, $P_0$, $\mu_0$ is
negligible because the bath is so large.

Writing
\[
U^B=U_0-U^\alpha-U^\beta
\]

\[
\tilde{S}^B=-\frac{U^\alpha}{T_0}-\frac{U^\beta}{T_0}+\frac{U_0}{T_0}+C_1
\]

\[
=-\frac{U^\alpha}{T_0}-\frac{U^\beta}{T_0}+C_2
\]

Thus,
\begin{align*}
S^{tot,eq}&=\max_{C}\left\{-\frac{U^\alpha}{T_0}-\frac{U^\beta}{T_0}+C_2+\tilde{S}^{\alpha+\beta}\right\}\\
&=C_2+\max_{C}\left\{-\frac{U^\alpha+U^\beta}{T_0}+\tilde{S}^\alpha+\tilde{S}^\beta\right\}\\
&=C_2+\max_{C}\left\{-\frac{F^\alpha+F^\beta}{T_0}\right\}\\
&=C_2-\frac{1}{T_0}\min_{C}\left\{F^\alpha(T_0,V^\alpha,N^\alpha)+F^\beta(T_0,V^\beta,N^\beta)\right\}
\end{align*}

Postulate VI: Consider a compound, otherwise-
isolated thermodynamic system in contact with
an otherwise-isolated heat bath at temperature
$T_0$. Equilibrium of the compound system is the
state satisfying the isothermal condition
\[
T^\alpha=T^\beta=T_0
\]

which minimizes
\[
F^\alpha(T_0,V^\alpha,N^\alpha)+F^\beta(T_0,V^\beta,N^\beta)
\]

subject to the constraints
\[
V^\alpha+V^\beta=V_0,\qquad\text{(volume conservation)}
\]
\[
N_i^\alpha+N_i^\beta=N_{i,0},\qquad\text{(mass conservation)}
\]

Remark: Since the system $\alpha+\beta$ exchanges
energy with the heat bath, energy is not
conserved in $\alpha+\beta$.

Energy is conserved in the system $B+\alpha+\beta$.
