Iteration Log for TestCase2-opus
=================================

Input: TestCase2.png - Temperature vs x_1 phase diagram with binodal/spinodal curves

v1: Initial attempt - All major elements present (binodal, spinodal, legend, red X, annotation).
    Issue: "Metastable Zone" annotation used a vertical line with right-angle connector
    instead of the diagonal line seen in the original.

v2: Fixed annotation to use a diagonal line from the label down to the crossing region.
    Adjusted double-arrow position. Result is close to original but arrow geometry
    could be slightly refined.

v3: Fine-tuned annotation line start/end coordinates and double-arrow position.
    Diagonal line now goes from (0.20, 0.75) to (0.23, 0.50).
    Double-arrow repositioned to (0.14, 0.34) -- (0.26, 0.34).
    ACCEPTED - Topologically equivalent, all elements match the original.

Total iterations: 3
Status: ACCEPTED
