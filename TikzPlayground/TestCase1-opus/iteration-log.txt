TestCase1 Phase Diagram - Iteration Log
========================================

Target: Two-phase system diagram with phi=1 (Phase 1) and phi=-1 (Phase 2),
separated by a wavy boundary with gray interface band of width epsilon.

v1: Initial attempt using f(x) = 1.5 + 0.25x + 1.2*sin(0.9x - 0.5) + 0.6*exp(-((x-6.5)^2)/0.5)
    - Good overall structure
    - Curve shape close to original
    - Gray band slightly narrow
    - Labels positioned correctly
    - Epsilon arrow positioned correctly

v2: Refined curve with adjusted parameters:
    f(x) = 1.3 + 0.20x + 1.3*sin(0.9x - 0.5) + 0.6*exp(-((x-6.5)^2)/0.5)
    - Used pgfmathdeclarefunction for cleaner code
    - Wider gray band (EpsHalf: 0.45 -> 0.50)
    - Slightly lower baseline, stronger wave amplitude
    - ACCEPTED: Topologically equivalent, labels match,
      curve shape matches the S-wave with bump pattern,
      gray interface band clearly visible, epsilon annotation correct.
