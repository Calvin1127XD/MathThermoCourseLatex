TestCase2 Phase Diagram - Iteration Log
========================================

Original Image: /Users/mingheiwong/Desktop/MathThermoCourseLatex/TestCase2.png

Description: Phase diagram showing Temperature vs x_1 (mole fraction) with:
- Binodal curve (solid, outer)
- Spinodal curve (dashed, inner)
- Critical point marked with red X at (0.5, T_c)
- Metastable zone labeled between the two curves

Phase 1: Python Drafting
------------------------
- Created draft.py to test candidate functions
- Analyzed curve properties:
  - Both curves are downward-opening parabolas (quadratic)
  - Symmetric about x = 0.5
  - Binodal has zeros at ~0.08 and ~0.92
  - Spinodal has zeros at ~0.22 and ~0.78
  - Both curves meet at critical point (0.5, T_c)

- Final parameters from Python:
  - Binodal: y = -4.9887 * (x - 0.08) * (x - 0.92)
  - Spinodal: y = -11.2245 * (x - 0.22) * (x - 0.78)
  - Critical temperature T_c = 0.88

- Python verification gate PASSED: draft.png matches original

Phase 2-3: TikZ Generation and Verification
--------------------------------------------
v1 (test.tex): Initial attempt
- All elements present and correct
- Minor issue: red X at critical point was too small
- Status: Close but could be improved

v2 (test-v2.tex): Refined version - ACCEPTED
- Increased figure size (12cm x 9cm)
- Made red X more prominent (\huge)
- Adjusted legend font size
- All topological features match original
- Status: ACCEPTED

Final verification:
- [x] Two curves with correct shapes (symmetric parabolas)
- [x] Binodal (solid) wider, Spinodal (dashed) narrower
- [x] Critical point at (0.5, 0.88) with red X
- [x] Metastable Zone label with arrow between curves
- [x] Legend in upper right corner
- [x] Axes labeled (Temperature, x_1)
- [x] x-axis ticks at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0

Total iterations: 2 (within limit of 6)
