Iteration Log for TestCase1 Phase Diagram
==========================================

v1: Initial attempt
- Created rectangular box (10x6 units)
- Added sine wave boundary with parameters: amplitude=0.4, wavelength=2.5, yoffset=3
- Gray shaded region for interface width epsilon=0.5
- Labels for phi=1/Phase 1 (top) and phi=-1/Phase 2 (bottom)
- Red arrow showing epsilon
- Status: INCORRECT - Gray shading filled entire bottom region instead of narrow band around boundary

v2: Fix gray shading logic
- Issue: The fill command filled from boundary down to bottom of box
- Fix: Used proper fill_between approach - only shade the narrow band between upper and lower boundaries
- Also reduced number of waves: wavelength 2.5 -> 3.5 (fewer waves)
- Status: ACCEPTED - Topologically equivalent to original
  - Gray band correctly shows only interface region
  - All labels present and correctly positioned
  - Wave structure captures the essential physics
  - Minor differences in exact wave count acceptable
