TestCase6 Convolution Diagram - Iteration Log
==============================================

Original: Convolution operation diagram showing I * K = I*K
- 7x7 input matrix I with red highlighted 3x3 region (cols 3-5, rows 0-2)
- 3x3 kernel K with blue border
- 5x5 output matrix I*K with green highlighted cell (row 0, col 3)
- Dotted lines connecting the highlighted regions
- Labels below each matrix

v1: Initial attempt - syntax error
    - Used \def macros in coordinate calculations which caused TikZ parsing errors
    - Error: "No shape named `(9+2' is known"

v2: Fixed coordinate calculations
    - Switched to \pgfmathsetmacro for pre-computed values
    - Used explicit coordinates instead of inline arithmetic
    - Compiled successfully
    - Issue: Red region was correct but vertical alignment of K and output needed adjustment

v3: Improved alignment - ACCEPTED
    - Adjusted vertical positioning of kernel K (centered around middle of diagram)
    - Moved output matrix to align properly with kernel
    - Verified all data values match original
    - Subscript annotations positioned correctly
    - Green dotted lines connect appropriate corners

Total iterations: 3 (within max 6 limit)
Status: ACCEPTED - topologically equivalent to original
