Quality Checklist for TestCase3 TikZ Conversion
================================================

PHASE 1: PREPARATION
[X] Working folder created in TikzPlayground/TestCase3-sonnet/
[X] Example library checked - browsed GoodTikzExample/
[X] Category identified - calculus/ (function plots)
[X] Examples reviewed - functions_plotting.tex, area_exp_line.tex
[X] Checked for explicit equations in image - NONE (estimated from visual)
[X] Curve properties analyzed:
    - f(x): increasing, concave up (quadratic)
    - h(x): decreasing, concave down (negative quadratic)
    - g(x): parabola with minimum at x≈2
[X] Mathematical functions identified correctly:
    - f(x) = 0.25*x^2 + 0.5*x + 0.5
    - h(x) = -0.25*x^2 + 0.5*x + 3.5
    - g(x) = 0.35*(x-2)^2 + 0.4
[X] Python draft attempted (matplotlib not available, skipped)

PHASE 2: TIKZ CODE GENERATION
[X] TikZ test code generated in playground
[X] Used pgfplots for function plotting
[X] Used fillbetween library for shaded regions
[X] All three functions defined with correct colors
[X] Vertical lines at x=a, b, c implemented
[X] Function labels added

PHASE 3: COMPILATION AND VERIFICATION
[X] Standalone compiled successfully in playground
[X] PDF visually compared to handwritten original
[X] Topological equivalence verified:
    [X] Same number of curves (3)
    [X] Correct relative positions
    [X] Proper labels and annotations
    [X] Accurate axes ranges and scales
    [X] Matching curve shapes (concave/convex, monotonic)
    [X] Correct arrows and flow directions
    [X] Gray shaded region between curves
    [X] Vertical lines at correct positions
[X] Iterations performed: 2 (within max 6 attempts)
[X] Each iteration saved: test-v1.tex, test-v2.tex
[X] Iteration log created documenting changes
[X] Stopped iterating when acceptance criteria met

PHASE 4: SAVE AND INTEGRATE
[X] Final .tex copied from playground: TestCase3-final.tex
[X] Final .pdf compiled in playground: TestCase3-final.pdf
[X] Figure ready for integration into main document

VERIFICATION RESULTS
=====================
Iteration count: 2
Status: ACCEPTED on iteration 2

v1 Issues:
- Labels overlapping and f(x) missing

v2 Fixes:
- Added clip=false to axis options
- Positioned all three labels explicitly with \node commands
- All labels now visible and properly positioned

Final Comparison with Original:
- Curve shapes: MATCH
- Curve colors: MATCH
- Vertical lines: MATCH
- Shaded region: MATCH
- Function labels: MATCH
- Axes and arrows: MATCH
- Overall topology: EQUIVALENT

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: ALL MET
