Iteration Log for TestCase3

v1: Initial attempt
- Curve shapes: GOOD - f(x) blue increasing concave up, h(x) red decreasing concave down, g(x) green parabola
- Vertical lines: GOOD - at x=a, b, c
- Shaded region: GOOD - gray area between curves from a to c
- Labels: ISSUE - f(x) label missing (only h(x) and g(x) visible)
- Label positions: ISSUE - g(x) and h(x) labels overlapping in same area
- Arrows on axes: GOOD - present and correct

Issues to fix:
1. Add f(x) label (currently missing from plot)
2. Adjust label positions to match original (f(x) upper right, h(x) lower right, g(x) mid right)
3. Labels should be outside the plot area, not overlapping

Status: Need v2 to fix label positioning

---

v2: Fixed label positioning
- Curve shapes: EXCELLENT - all three curves match original perfectly
- Vertical lines: EXCELLENT - at x=a, b, c with proper labels
- Shaded region: EXCELLENT - gray area between curves from a to c
- Labels: EXCELLENT - all three function labels (f(x), h(x), g(x)) now visible and positioned correctly
- Label positions: EXCELLENT - f(x) upper right, h(x) lower right, g(x) middle right
- Arrows on axes: EXCELLENT - present and correct
- Overall topology: MATCHES ORIGINAL

Verification against original TestCase3.png:
✓ Three colored functions: f(x) blue, h(x) red, g(x) green
✓ Correct curve shapes and positions
✓ Vertical lines at x=a, b, c
✓ Gray shaded area between curves
✓ All function labels visible and positioned correctly
✓ Axes with arrows
✓ Topologically equivalent

Status: ACCEPTED - All acceptance criteria met
