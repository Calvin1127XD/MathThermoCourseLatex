TestCase4 - Polar Coordinate Region Diagram
============================================

Original image: /Users/mingheiwong/Desktop/MathThermoCourseLatex/TestCase4.png

Description: A polar coordinate diagram showing a region bounded by:
- Two rays at angles theta = alpha and theta = beta
- Inner curve r = h1(theta) (red)
- Outer curve r = h2(theta) (blue)
- Green shaded region between the curves

Phase 1: Python Drafting
------------------------
- Created draft.py to experiment with polar coordinate visualization
- Tested quadratic functions for h1 and h2 curves
- Used alpha = 25 degrees, beta = 70 degrees
- h1(theta) = 1.3 + 0.8*s + 0.2*s^2 where s = (theta-alpha)/(beta-alpha)
- h2(theta) = 2.5 + 0.6*s + 0.3*s^2
- Python verification gate: PASSED

Phase 2-3: TikZ Generation and Verification
-------------------------------------------
v1 (test.tex):
- Initial TikZ implementation using polar coordinates
- Structure correct but labels overlapping with curves
- Scale was adequate

v2 (test-v2.tex):
- Increased scale from 1.2 to 1.5
- Repositioned labels using anchor options
- theta = beta: anchor=south east
- theta = alpha: anchor=west
- r = h1(theta): anchor=east, positioned inside region
- r = h2(theta): anchor=south west, positioned outside
- ACCEPTED - topologically equivalent to original

Final result: test-v2.tex (2 iterations)

Techniques used:
- TikZ polar coordinates with plot[smooth]
- Custom radial functions expressed as normalized parametric curves
- Fill path combining forward and reverse curve traversal
- Anchor-based label positioning
