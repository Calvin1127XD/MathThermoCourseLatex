Iteration Log for TestCase2 Phase Diagram
==========================================

v1: Initial attempt
- Binodal and Spinodal curves created using parabolas
- Red X at spinodal maximum
- Metastable Zone label present
- Double-headed arrow indicating metastable zone width
- Legend in upper right corner

Comparison with original:
ISSUES:
1. Legend format - using table instead of line samples (legend looks different)
2. Red X size/style might need adjustment
3. Arrow position might need fine-tuning

ACCEPTED ELEMENTS:
+ Curve shapes are correct (symmetric parabolas)
+ Both curves touch at correct x-values
+ Red X at spinodal maximum is present
+ Metastable Zone label is positioned correctly
+ Overall topology matches the original

Status: Need to improve legend appearance

---

v2: Improved legend
- Changed legend from table format to embedded tikzpicture with actual line drawings
- Legend now uses proper solid and dashed lines
- Red X slightly larger and bolder for better visibility
- All other elements preserved from v1

Comparison with original:
✓ Binodal curve (solid): Correct shape, position, and extent
✓ Spinodal curve (dashed): Correct shape, position, and extent
✓ Red X at spinodal maximum: Present and visible
✓ Metastable Zone label: Correct position and formatting
✓ Double-headed arrow: Present showing metastable zone width
✓ Legend: Clean format with line samples matching curve styles
✓ Axis labels: x₁ on x-axis, Temperature on y-axis
✓ Tick marks: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 shown on x-axis
✓ Overall topology: Matches original structure

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA CHECK:
✓ Same number of curves/lines/objects - YES (2 curves, 1 marker, 1 arrow, 1 label, 1 legend)
✓ Correct relative positions - YES (spinodal inside binodal, X at maximum)
✓ Proper labels and annotations - YES (all labels present and positioned correctly)
✓ Accurate axes ranges and scales - YES (x: 0-1, appropriate y-range)
✓ Matching curve shapes - YES (symmetric parabolas, correct concavity)
✓ Correct arrows and flow directions - YES (double-headed arrow correct)

Status: ACCEPTED - Topologically equivalent and visually similar to original
